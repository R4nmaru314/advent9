Here's a breakdown of the program's functionality:

1. Data Structures:
- Coordinate: A struct to represent a point on the grid with x and y integer coordinates.
- coordinatesHead: A slice of Coordinate that seems to track the main path of the entity.
- coordinatesTails: A slice of slices of Coordinate, with each inner slice possibly representing a trailing path or some related path to the main one.

2. File Reading:
- The program opens input.txt and reads it line by line.
- Each line is expected to contain a direction and a count, separated by a space.

3. Movement Processing:
- The calculateCoordinates function updates the coordinatesHead and coordinatesTails based on the direction and count.
- There are separate functions for each direction (calculateCoordinatesRight, calculateCoordinatesLeft, calculateCoordinatesUp, calculateCoordinatesDown) that append new coordinates to the coordinatesHead and call calculateTails to update coordinatesTails.

4. Tail Calculation:
- The calculateTails function updates each of the 9 tail paths based on the last coordinate.
- The calculateTail function calculates the next point in a tail path based on the last point in that tail and the last coordinate of the main path.

5. Distance Checking:
- The isTwoUnitsAwayX and isTwoUnitsAwayY functions check if two coordinates are exactly two units apart horizontally or vertically.

6. Duplicate Removal:
- The removeDuplicates function removes duplicate coordinates from a slice of Coordinate.

7. Logging:
- After processing all lines from the file, the program logs the length of the unique coordinates in the first and last tail paths.
